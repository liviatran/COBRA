##CIWD_C1_netmhcpan
#'HLA Class I CIWD Allele files
#'
#'A folder containing all Common, Intermediate, Well-Documented (CIWD) v 3.0.0 Class I
#'HLA Alleles. These files will be used as input if NetMHCpan is selected as the
#'Binding Affinity Predictor for Class I alleles. The source file was parsed
#'to only include Class I CIWD alleles, to only alleles allowed by netMHCpan, 
#'and non-expression alleles (N, S, C, A and Q) were filtered out. The comprehensive
#'list of Class I CIWD HLA alleles was broken up to generate files of 45 alleles per file,
#'due to netMHCpan's maximum allele evaluation capacity.
