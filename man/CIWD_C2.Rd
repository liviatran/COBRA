\description{
A folder containing all CIWD v 3.0.0 DRB1, DQB1, and DPB1 alleles, and CWD v 2.0.0
CWD v 2.0.0 DPA1 and DQA1 alleles. The source files were parsed
to only include Class II CIWD/CWD alleles, to only alleles allowed by netMHCIIpan, 
and non-expression alleles (N, S, C, A and Q) were filtered out. The 
comprehensive list of CIWD/CWD Class II HLA alleles was broken up to generate 
20 alleles per file to accommodate netMHCIIPanâ€™s maximum allele evaluation capacity.  
The source files were also manipulated to create all possible heterodimers for DP and DQ, 
including forbidden heterodimers.
