Description: The COVID-19 Binding Repertore Assessment (COBRA) tool is a R pipeline that predicts HLA peptide binding affinity to SARS-CoV2 proteins, and quantifies the number of binders based on strength for a given HLA genotype in a BIGDAWG formatted dataset. Although COBRA was designed with predicting peptide binding affinity for SARS-CoV-2, it can be used to generate binding affinity predictions for HLA alleles and any proteome. For more details on COBRA's workflow, please see the vignette.
